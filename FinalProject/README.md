### Description of folder 📁
In this folder , here have two folder , First is `train_step_code` , second is `test_code`

#### `train_step_code` 📂
Inside have `Normal training model`, this is put some different model training codes, and the second one is called `ResNet50_step`, inside is put our group model training step code. the Notice is if you want to train your model, you need to change the save model path and the epoch number.

#### `test_code` 📂
Inside has put the code of the ResNet50 model for testing, the mention is if you want to test, you need to change the model loading path and the output result file path.  

- `ResNet50_test.ipynb`:This file is using the handmade dataset to do testing. 
- `ResNet50_test_teach.ipynb`:This file is using the teacher to provide a dataset to do testing.
- `ResNet50_test_teach_Image_Net_balance.ipynb`:This file is using ImageNet hand-made balance dataset to do testing. (each class has around 200 photos)
