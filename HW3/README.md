## Written By 練鈞揚 😎
### Py env : Anaconda Py3.11 🐍
### Running env: Window 🪟 , Linux 🐧

---
### File Type 📁
File using : py

#### ***File `svm_auto_train.7z` is the zip file of output result  `svm_c_auto_train` and `svm_s_auto_train`***

---

### How to run 🏃

1. Open in vscode 
2. please `pip install -U libsvm-official`
3. type `python HW3_auto_train_c.py` and `python HW3_auto_train_n.py` to run

*Linux user, remember to `make` file*

-> command : `./linux/make`

### Result 
you will get two folder 
- `svm_c_auto_train`
- `svm_s_auto_train`

#### Detail

- `csv`:save the accuracy
- `image`: save the accuracy image
- `model`: save all training model
- `support vector` save all model support vector in each folder and the support vector number and image 
- `support vector coef` save all model support vector coefficient
